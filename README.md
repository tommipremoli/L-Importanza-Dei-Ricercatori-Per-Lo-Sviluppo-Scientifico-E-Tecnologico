This analysis investigates the impact of selected variables on the number of researchers across OECD countries. Key factors include R&D investment relative to GDP, patent applications, tertiary education expenditure, unemployment rate, and GDP per capita. The results highlight significant regional differences, with Asia-Pacific, Northern and Western Europe, and North America leading in research and innovation, while regions like Latin America and Southern Europe lag behind. The findings, compared with the Global Innovation Index, emphasize the need for equitable resource distribution to foster global scientific progress.
